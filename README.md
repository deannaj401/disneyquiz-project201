This project is a quiz that asks 5 questions. After the "Happily Ever After" button is pushed the user then clicks another link to go to a page where a Disney Character is dynamically rendered according to the quiz score. The page includes a character image, a short personality description, a fun fact and also a food and drink recipe that is themed to the character. The food and drink images contain a link to the recipe. The user can also play again and get a different character by giving different answers to the quiz and getting a different score. 

We used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and localStorage for this quiz. Adobe Photoshop was used to render the images. The characters came from cells off of Animation Screencaps
